# Graph diffusion model with weak masking for molecule editing



## Description
This repo contains the code, data and samples for our graph diffusion model with weak masking for molecule editing. This project is for KAIST CS471 course. Our code builds on [DiGress](https://github.com/cvignac/DiGress).

## Environment installation
This code was tested with PyTorch 2.0.1, cuda 11.8 and torch_geometrics 2.3.1

  - Download anaconda/miniconda if needed
  - Create a rdkit environment that directly contains rdkit:
    
    ```conda create -c conda-forge -n digress rdkit=2023.03.2 python=3.9```
  - `conda activate digress`
  - Check that this line does not return an error:
    
    ``` python3 -c 'from rdkit import Chem' ```
  - Install graph-tool (https://graph-tool.skewed.de/): 
    
    ```conda install -c conda-forge graph-tool=2.45```
  - Check that this line does not return an error:
    
    ```python3 -c 'import graph_tool as gt' ```
  - Install the nvcc drivers for your cuda version. For example:
    
    ```conda install -c "nvidia/label/cuda-11.8.0" cuda```
  - Install a corresponding version of pytorch, for example: 
    
    ```pip3 install torch==2.0.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118```
  - Install other packages using the requirement file: 
    
    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

  - Run:
    
    ```pip install -e .```



Note: graph_tool and torch_geometric currently seem to conflict on MacOS, I have not solved this issue yet.

## Run the code
  
  - All code is currently launched through `python3 main.py`. Check hydra documentation (https://hydra.cc/) for overriding default parameters.
